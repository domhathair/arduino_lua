# Arduino Lua Interpreter

A basic example of an embedded Lua interpreter within the Arduino framework

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Lua interpreter with Arduino, allowing you to run Lua scripts on Arduino-compatible hardware. This can be useful for adding scripting capabilities to your embedded projects.  
The project was built on a Raspberry Pi Pico board, but can be easily edited for other boards thanks to the PlatformIO IDE
